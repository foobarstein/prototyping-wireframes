## Prototype

Taking the [mockups](../2.mockups/) made from wireframes and throwing them into a prototyping tool, such as [InvisionApp Prototype](https://www.invisionapp.com/cloud/prototype), we can quckly turn our cryptic app or web site jottings into a clickable prototype that all can understand.

In addition to hosting prototypes on their own servers, InvisionApp can export prototypes as stand-alone web pages for offline use.
