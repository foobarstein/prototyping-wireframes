# Prototyping from Wireframe Diagrams

This repository contains some simple wireframe diagrams for a generic web site/app. These wireframes are then filled with mock content (text and imagery) in order to make them look more "real", so they can be placed into a clickable prototype.

A video walkthrough of [this example is available on YouTube](https://youtu.be/fNhLpwL1Iag).

## Wireframes

The aim of the wireframe diagrams is to show just enough information for a stakeholder or developer to understand the details of what is on each screen (also known as a page or view). In particular:

1. What kind of content is on each screen.
1. What is the approximate placement of each piece of content on each screen.
1. Any functionality that is non-obvious that people involved in the project should be aware of.
1. How might a user navigate from one screen to the next in an intuitive, easy manner.
1. How might a user drill-down from the screen that they enter from to the screens that they may find contain content of interest to them.

## Mock content

Wireframes are, by nature, abstract and easily understood by all stakeholders. For this reason, it is sometimes useful to reduce the abstraction of wireframes by filling them in with mock copy and imagery. In cases where multiple screens will follow the template or pattern set out in a single wireframe diagram, the wireframe is converted into multiple mocked-up screens.

## Clickable prototype

The aim of the clickable prototype is to allow stakeholders and developers to experience a crude version of how the site or app might behave when complete, so they can develop a visceral sense of it.

Depending on the needs of the team, the prototype might be constructed from wireframe diagrams (as done here) or from high-quality design comps.

Ultimately, the prototype should show just enough to allow all stakeholders to discuss and hopefully come to agreement about what is the correct content and functionality for the project at hand.
